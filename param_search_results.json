The Rhea AI model is worse than the original text, not because of the training dataset but because the model is designed to be inferior. \n\nI think the training dataset for this model is actually pretty good, and the model is bad because the designers are intentionally making it bad. \n\nTraining for machine learning is not easy. There is a lot of experimentation involved. \n\nBut the difficulty is not in the training dataset. It is in the model itself. \n\nI don't think there is a way to make the model better without fundamentally changing how it is designed. \n\nThat is why we must be careful with AI technology. \n\nI hope we will always be able to continue to challenge AI and push it",
